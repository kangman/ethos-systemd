# Determine how many /24 networks fit into the given VPC_CIDR.  Yes, this is ugly for two reasons.
# One, ssh_config only allows string pattern matching, so for subnets, one can only use a network
# terminated with a wildcard for the last octet.  Second, there's a limit to the size of the VPC
# that can be allocated in Adobe private address space.  HamCIDR only allows CIDR blocks from /25
# to /22, so any other value is bypassing SOP.  A case statement can't do range comparisons, and
# I didn't want to implement a subnet calculator in BASH, so there's this:
